# üìö JavaScript Learning Roadmap

This repository is dedicated to my journey of studying **JavaScript** in a structured way, covering both fundamentals and advanced concepts.  
The goal is to build a solid foundation while creating small examples and projects along the way.

## üóÇÔ∏è Study Steps

1. **Introduction to JavaScript**  
   Basics of the language, history, usage, and environment setup.

2. **All About Variables**  
   `var`, `let`, `const`, scoping, and best practices.

3. **Data Types**  
   Primitive and reference types, `typeof`, and dynamic typing.

4. **Type Casting**  
   Implicit vs. explicit conversions, coercion pitfalls.

5. **Data Structures**  
   Arrays, Objects, Maps, Sets, and when to use each.

6. **Equality Comparisons**  
   `==` vs `===`, truthy and falsy values.

7. **Loops and Iterations**  
   `for`, `while`, `do...while`, `for...of`, `for...in`, `forEach`.

8. **Control Flow**  
   `if`, `else`, `switch`, `try...catch`.

9. **Expressions & Operators**  
   Arithmetic, logical, relational, spread, and ternary operators.

10. **Functions**  
    Function declarations, expressions, arrow functions, higher-order functions.

11. **DOM APIs**  
    Selecting, creating, modifying, and removing elements dynamically.

12. **Strict Mode**  
    Benefits, usage, and differences in behavior.

13. **Using `this` Keyword**  
    Global context, object context, arrow functions, binding.

14. **Asynchronous JavaScript**  
    Callbacks, Promises, `async/await`, event loop.

15. **Working with APIs**  
    Fetch API, REST, JSON, error handling.

16. **Classes**  
    ES6 classes, inheritance, encapsulation, prototypes.

17. **Iterators and Generators**  
    Custom iterators, `yield`, generator functions.

18. **Modules in JS**  
    `import`, `export`, CommonJS vs ES Modules.

19. **Memory Management**  
    Garbage collection, memory leaks, optimization tips.

20. **Using Browser DevTools**  
    Debugging, breakpoints, performance monitoring, network analysis.

## üìå Notes

This repo is **not a framework or library**, but a **learning journal**.  
It‚Äôs meant to help track my study path and share knowledge with others learning JavaScript.
