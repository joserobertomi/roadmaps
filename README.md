# Roadmaps

A curated collection of tech stacks I’m currently exploring, inspired by [ROADMAP.sh](https://roadmap.sh/).  
This repository is aimed at developers who already have experience with various technologies but want to expand their knowledge into new stacks, tools, and paradigms.

## About

I’ve worked with several stacks and technologies in the past, but this repo is focused on **learning and experimenting with new tools**. The goal is to document my journey, track progress, and share insights with others who are looking to broaden their development skillset.

## Structure

The repository is organized by technology domain:

- **Frontend** – Modern frameworks, libraries, and UI/UX patterns.
- **Backend** – Server-side frameworks, databases, and APIs.
- **DevOps / Cloud** – CI/CD pipelines, cloud providers, containerization.
- **Data & AI** – Data processing, machine learning frameworks, and analytics.
- **Other** – Tools, utilities, and experimental stacks.

Each section contains resources, notes, and project ideas to practice and solidify the learning.
